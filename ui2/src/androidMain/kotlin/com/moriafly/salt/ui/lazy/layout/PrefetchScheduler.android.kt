/**
 * Android specific prefetch implementation. The only platform specific things are:
 * 1) Calculating the deadline
 * 2) Posting the delayed runnable This could be refactored in the future in order to keep the most
 *    logic platform agnostic to enable the prefetching on desktop.
 *
 * The differences with the implementation in RecyclerView:
 * 1) Prefetch is per-list-index, and performed on whole item. With RecyclerView, nested scrolling
 *    RecyclerViews would prefetch incrementally, e.g. items like the following in a scrolling
 *    vertical list could be broken up within a frame: [Row1 [a], [b], [c]] [Row2 [d], [e]]
 *    [Row3 [f], [g], [h]] You could have frames that break up this work arbitrarily: Frame 1 -
 *    prefetch [a] Frame 2 - prefetch [b], [c] Frame 3 - prefetch [d] Frame 4 - prefetch [e], [f]
 *    Something similar is not possible with LazyColumn yet.
 * 2) Prefetching time estimation only captured during the prefetch. We currently don't track the
 *    time of the regular subcompose call happened during the regular measure pass, only the ones
 *    which are done during the prefetching. The downside is we build our prefetch information only
 *    after scrolling has started and items are showing up. Your very first scroll won't know if
 *    it's safe to prefetch. Why: a) SubcomposeLayout is not exposing an API to understand if
 *    subcompose() call is going to do the real work. The work could be skipped if the same lambda
 *    was passed as for the previous invocation or if there were no recompositions scheduled. We
 *    could workaround it by keeping the extra state in LazyListState about what items we already
 *    composed and to only measure the first composition for the given slot, or consider exposing
 *    extra information in SubcomposeLayoutState API. b) It allows us to nicely decouple the logic,
 *    now the prefetching logic is build on top of the regular LazyColumn measuring functionallity
 *    and the main logic knows nothing about prefetch c) Maybe the better approach would be to wait
 *    till the low-level runtime infra is ready to do subcompositions on the different threads which
 *    illuminates the need to calculate the deadlines completely. Tracking bug: b/187393381.
 * 3) Prefetch is not aware of item type. RecyclerView separates timing metadata about different
 *    item types. For example, in play store style UI, this allows RecyclerView to separately
 *    estimate the cost of a header, separator, and item row. In this implementation, all of these
 *    would be averaged together in the same estimation. There is no view type concept in LazyColumn
 *    at all. What can we possible do: a) Think of different item/items calls in the builder dsl as
 *    different view types automatically. It is close enough but still not entirely correct if the
 *    user have something like a list of elements which are objects of some sealed classes and they
 *    consider different classes as completely different types b) Maybe if we would be able to
 *    precompose on the different thread this issue is also not so critical given that we don't need
 *    to calculate the deadline. Tracking bug: 187393922
